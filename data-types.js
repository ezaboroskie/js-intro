// This is a simple introduction to JavaScript basics

// Data Types: String, Number and Bigint, Boolean, Object, Symbol, Undefined, and Null
// Strings: A string is read as text and is enclosed in quotes

let string1 = 'Hello'
let string2 = "World"


// strings can contain numbers but will only be read and evaluated as a string as long as the quotes encompass the number
let stringNumber = '1'

//concatString will concatinate into the string '12'
let concatString = '1' + '2'
